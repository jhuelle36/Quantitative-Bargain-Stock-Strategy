# Quantitative-Bargain-Stock-Strategy
Developed a quantitative value investing strategy using Python and financial data APIs to select 50 stocks with the best value metrics based on price-to-earnings, price-to-book, price-to-sales ratios, and more. Used the help of FreeCodeCamp.org to assist developing my project!
